Website [http://tue-robotics.github.io/](http://tue-robotics.github.io/) online where we can put technical posts, overviews or pages. Also take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-robotics.github.io/wiki)

You can simply add a page the root of [this repository](https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-robotics.github.io) (see example [software-architecture.html](https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-robotics.github.io/blob/master/software-architecture.html)) or add a post to the [_posts directory](https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-robotics.github.io/tree/master/_posts). Pages can be written in markdown or html and must have a .yaml formatter. For more information, check out the following page: [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

Feel free to add new pages / posts.
