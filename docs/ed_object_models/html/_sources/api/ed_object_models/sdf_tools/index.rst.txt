.. py:function:: get_sdf_string(model_type)

   Get sdf string of a specific model. Searching in GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH

   :param model_type: name of the model
   :return: xml string, empty in case of error


.. py:function:: spawn_sdf_from_yaml(yaml_path)

   Spawns a list of sdf models from a yaml file into Gazebo.

   :param yaml_path: path to a yaml file.

   The yaml file that yaml_path points to should be a dictonary or a list of dictionaries.
   Each dictionary should at least contain the keys id, type, x, y and z,
   additional optional keys are roll, pitch and yaw. The meaning of the keys are:
   - id: a string which defines the name given to the loaded model in gazebo.
   - type: a string which refers to a sdf model name contained within GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH.
   - x, y, z: floats representing the coordinates at which the model is spawned.
   - roll, pitch, yaw: floats representing Euler angles, if not used they are set to zero.
   An example of such a dictionary list item is given below:
   - {id: "coke-1", type: "coke_can", x: 3.196, y: 4.652, z: 0.87, roll: 0.5, pitch: 1.57}
