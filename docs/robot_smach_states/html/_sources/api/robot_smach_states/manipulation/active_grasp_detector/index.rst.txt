.. py:class:: ActiveGraspDetector(robot, arm_designator, threshold_difference = 0.075, minimum_position = -0.82, max_torque = 0.15)

   Bases: :py:obj:`smach.State`


   
   State for detecting whether the robot is holding something using the gripper position.

   Stores current position of the hand motor joint, slightly closes the gripper and then compares the new
   position with the first one. If the difference is bigger than the threshold, robot is holding something

   If the object is too small/thin it will not be able to determine

   :param robot: Robot to execute the state with
   :param arm_designator: designator that resolves to arm to check
   :param threshold_difference: Difference between base and final position
   :param minimum_position: Minimum position to assume that the gripper is holding something
   :param max_torque: Max torque of the gripper to perform the test with
