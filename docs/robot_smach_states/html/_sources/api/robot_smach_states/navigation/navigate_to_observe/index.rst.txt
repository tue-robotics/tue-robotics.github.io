.. py:class:: NavigateToObserve(robot, entity_designator, radius=0.7, margin=0.075, room = None, reset_head=True, speak=True, reset_pose=True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`robot_smach_states.navigation.navigation.NavigateTo`


   Move the robot to a specified location.

   :param robot: Robot object
   :param constraint_function: function resolving to a tuple(PositionConstraint, OrientationConstraint)
       telling the robot where to drive to.
   :param reset_head: Whether or not the head should be used for obstacle avoidance during navigation.
   :param speak: Whether or not the robot should speak during navigation
   :param reset_pose: Whether or not the robot is allowed to change its pose for navigation.

   Navigates to a radius from an ed entity. If a convex hull is present, the distance
   to the convex hull is used. Otherwise, the distance to the pose of the entity is used

   :param robot: (Robot) object
   :param entity_designator: EdEntityDesignator for the object to observe
   :param radius: (float) desired distance to the pose of the entity [m]
   :param margin: (float) allowed margin w.r.t. specified radius on both sides [m]
   :param room: (Optional) Designator to the room you want to stay in
   :param reset_head: Whether or not the head should be used for obstacle avoidance during navigation.
   :param speak: Whether or not the robot should speak during navigation
   :param reset_pose: Whether or not the robot is allowed to change its pose for navigation.
