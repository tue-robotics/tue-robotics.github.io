.. py:function:: arms_reach_constraint(pose_designator, arm_designator, look=True, lower_margin = 0.075, upper_margin = 0.075)

   Position so that the arm can reach the position/entity

   :param pose_designator: designator that resolves to a FrameStamped of the point to be reached
   :param arm_designator: PublicArmDesignator or arm to use for manipulation
   :param look: bool, whether the orientation must be constrained as well
   :param lower_margin: lower margin of the reachability radius
   :param upper_margin: upper margin of the reachability radius
   :return: navigation constraints, if a designator does not resolve None is returned
   :rtype: tuple(PositionConstraint, OrientationConstraint)
