smach_ros
==================================================

.. raw:: html

    <p>The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to
    integrate it tightly with ROS.  For example, SMACH-ROS can call
    ROS services, listen to ROS topics, and integrate
    with <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/actionlib">actionlib</a>
    both as a client, and a provider of action servers.  SMACH is a
    new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to
    quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular
    code.</p>
