.. py:class:: SSL(robot_name, tf_buffer)

   Bases: :py:obj:`robot_skills.robot_part.RobotPart`


   Sound source localization interface for the robot

    We only expose the get_last_yaw method here that transforms the incoming PoseStamped from the back-end to a
    yaw in the frame of the incoming message. The user of this method should take into account that the yaw is
    represented in this frame.

   :param topic: Incoming PoseStamped

   constructor

   :param robot_name: robot_name
   :param tf_buffer: tf2_ros.Buffer


   .. py:attribute:: _sub


   .. py:attribute:: _last_msg
      :value: None



   .. py:attribute:: _last_received_time


   .. py:property:: operational

      Check whether this bodypart's hardware is operational
      If the associated hardware is not yet up, has an error etc, the bodypart is not operational. Note: in
      in simulation: operational is always true

      :rtype: bool True is part is ready to do work, False otherwise


   .. py:method:: _callback(msg)

      callback

      :param msg: incoming msg, PoseStamped
      :return: no return



   .. py:method:: get_last_yaw(max_age_seconds=2)

      Get last yaw rotation of the sound source localisation in the frame of the device

      :param max_age_seconds: maximum age of the last received direction of the sound, when older None is returned
      :type max_age_seconds: int
      :return: yaw
